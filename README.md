Website Project for CISC.3650 - Human-Computer Interaction at Brooklyn College. Try not to use this code to cheat on any assignments (though I doubt any assignment will be similar to this).

The website (when live) can be found at https://llyu0966.github.io/main.html

Description:
The website allows users to upload school information about themselves with the goal of finding their classmates who lost the contact with. Through the search, users also are able to find the memories of youth. The demographics of the users are everyone who tries to retrieve their memories.
